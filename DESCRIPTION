Description: Provides functions to format and summarise already computed outputs from commonly used statistical and psychometric functions into compact, single-row tables and simple graphs, with utilities to export results to CSV, Word, and Excel formats. The package does not implement new statistical methods or estimation procedures; instead, it organises and presents results obtained from existing functions such as psych::describe(), psych::alpha(), stats::t.test(), and gtsummary::tbl_summary() to streamline reporting workflows in clinical and psychological research.
